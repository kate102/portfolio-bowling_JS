# The Bowling Challenge

## Introduction
I have completed this challenge before, in week 5. 
It is now week 11 and I look back at my code for this challenge with a mixture of fondness and exhasperation.
My recollection was that I enjoyed this challenge but I can not work out what my code does, or how it passes the tests.
This time will be different.

## Set Up
- On the command line I created a new directory.
- I cloned the original repository to this directory and created a new repository in GitHub.
- I changed the master to be my new GitHub reposirtoy `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/kate102/portfolio-bowling_JS.git`.
- I then pushed up the details of the challenge to the new repository.
- On GitHub I created a new branch called `README-branch` so that I can write to the README on GitHub and not get into a merge situation with the code from the command line.
