# The Bowling Challenge

## Introduction
I have completed this challenge before, in week 5. 
It is now week 11 and I look back at my code for this challenge with a mixture of fondness and exasperation.
My recollection was that I enjoyed this challenge but I can not work out what my code does, or how it passes the tests.
This time will be different.

## Set Up
- On the command line I created a new directory.
- I cloned the original repository to this directory and created a new repository in GitHub.
- I changed the master to be my new GitHub reposirtoy `git remote set-url origin https://github.com/kate102/portfolio-bowling_JS.git`.
- I then pushed up the details of the challenge to the new repository.
- On GitHub I created a new branch called `README-branch` so that I can write to the README on GitHub and not get into a merge situation with the code from the command line.
- I then logged onto `Travis` and added this repository, this will provide continuous integration and  
- I then installed `ESLint` [https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started] which will check my code quality


## Process
The quality of my code the last time around was poor, (although it worked!) and my code is cleaner now, but my process is much better. the process that I intend to follow for this challenge is the following:
1. Read the challenge and identify the next simplest step
2. Plan how I am going to test for the step
3. Write the test for that step, this will fail
4. Implement the simplest code to pass the test 
5. Refactor the code if possible
6. Commit the code to github
7. Start again at 1.
